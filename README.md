- **npm 10+** (comes with Node.js)

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd greedy
   ```

2. **Start the development environment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile dev up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - The app reloads automatically on code changes

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npm run init-db
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./campaign.db"

# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# Development
NODE_ENV=development
```

- Fixed adventure form redirect using useEffect to avoid state update during render
- Enhanced form field handling with optional chaining and proper null checks

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Code Quality Commands

```bash
# Lint the codebase
npm run lint

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Initialize database
npm run init-db
```

### Form Handling Best Practices

All form submissions use Server Actions with Zod validation:

```typescript
// ✅ Server Action with validation
"use server";
export async function createAdventure(
  prevState: { success: boolean; error?: string },
  formData: FormData
) {
  const validation = validateFormData(AdventureFormSchema, {...});
  if (!validation.success) return { success: false, error: validation.errors };
  // Process form...
}
```

### Component Patterns

- **Form Components**: Use `useActionState` for form submission with optimistic updates
- **Entity Dialogs**: Modal components for assignment and linking operations
- **Images**: Use `EntityImageCarousel` for consistent image viewing experience
- **Validation**: Always validate on both client and server using Zod schemas

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Server Components + Client Components Strategy

- **Server Components** fetch data securely and handle sensitive operations
- **Client Components** manage interactive UI and real-time user feedback
- **Server Actions** handle mutations with built-in CSRF protection

### Database Schema Features

- **Campaign Scoping**: Most entities belong to a campaign for data isolation
- **Adventure Scoping**: Sessions and related data can be scoped to adventures
- **Entity Relationships**: Flexible relationship system supporting any entity-to-entity connection
- **Diary Entries**: Support for character, location, and quest diary entries with linked entities
- **Wiki Integration**: Two-way linking between wiki articles and campaign entities

## 🚢 Production Deployment

### Docker Production Build

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.app.yml up --build -d
```

### Environment Variables for Production

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./campaign.db"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://your-domain.com"
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Backup & Maintenance

- Regularly backup the `campaign.db` file
- Test migrations before production deployment
- Monitor container logs: `docker logs <container-id>`
